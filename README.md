## Fork & Clone this repository

* We did this in a previous assignment. Instructions are here: https://github.com/cmcntsh/exerGitPractice
* This can also be done directly in VSCode
  * Create a new folder on your machine where you want to put this repository if you don't already have one you want to use.
  * Copy the Clone or Download path for this repository from GitHub.
  * In VSCode from the command pallette (Ctrl-Shift-P) run Git: Clone
  * Paste the path into the path field which pops up
  * Select your new folder you created on your machine
  * A new folder for the repository with the repository files should be in the folder you selected showing in the Explorer window in VSCode on the left side.

## Create a Jupyter Notebook .ipynb file

* 2022 update: 
  * The files have been created for you and put in the folder called files.
  * Complete the assignment using the Jupyter Notebook included in the repository.
* (old information - you don't need to do this) In Jupyter Notebook or VSCode navigate to your repository folder.
  * Create a new Jupyter Notebook called FileRenameTutorial.ipynb

## Watch Tutorial

* Follow along with Python tutorial: File renaming (13 min): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ve2pmm5JqmI&list=PLG9A6ovzPqX6d9uWzx0UYN9pm0zzl5ofA&index=25&t=0s
* 2022 update: 
  * The files have been created for you and put in the folder called files.
  * Complete the assignment using the Jupyter Notebook included in the repository.
* (old information - you don't need to do this) The presenter works with a set of files he already has. We don't have those files, but we're really only concerned with the names. He's working with mp4 files. It may be helpful if you create files with the same names (or at least files with names that follow the same pattern) as the files he has. You can easily create dummy .txt files with the same names in a folder before you start the tutorial. 
  * Earth - Our solar system - #4.txt
  * Jupiter - Our solar system - #6.txt
  * Mars - Our solar system - #5.txt
  * Mercury - Our solar system - #2.txt
  * Neptune - Our solar system - #8.txt
  * Pluto - Our solar system - #10.txt
  * Saturn - Our solar system - #7.txt
  * The Sun - Our solar system - #1.txt
  * Uranus - Our solar system - #9.txt
  * Venus - Our solar system - #3.txt
* Execute code examples in separate cells.  
* When you're done make sure you save your file.

## Push your updated file to your GitHub repository

* This can be done in VSCode.
  * In VSCode click on the Source Control button.
  * You should see the files that had changes. (Mine has the original file which shows an M next to it and a new file which says checkpoint in the name. You really only need to push the original file, but if you push both it shouldn't hurt anything.)
  * Hover over the changed file. Click the + sign to stage the change.
  * Enter a commit message in the message field and click the checkmark to commit the change.
  * Click on the 3 dots for more actions and select Sync. This will push the updated file to your GitHub repository.
  * Submit the link to your GitHub repository on Canvas.
